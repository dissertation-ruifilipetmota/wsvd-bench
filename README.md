# wsvd-bench

This project contains the source code of the services that serve as `workload` of a benchmark for tools able to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities in web services.
The benchmark was introduced in [1], the papers explains the results and how they were obtained. The benchmark was later reused and extended in [2].

The ground truth of this workload is presented in the [detailed results](data/wsvd-bench-results-webservices-sqlinjection.xlsx) file.
In practice, it presents what is considered as the True Vulnerabilities (TV).

###  Detailed usage steps:

1. A script to fill a `PostgreSQL` database can be found in database dump](data). It is a small version, just for demo.
2. Then, you need to configure the class `Database.java`
3. You can (must) replace the class `Logging.java` for your favorite logging framework.
4. Install the missing `maven` dependencies, located inside [install](install)
5. Build the `maven` package, 
6. After this, you just need to deploy the services in your app server.
